What is Daereum?
----------------

Daereum is an experimental digital asset that makes it easy to make payments to anyone, anywhere in the world.
Daereum uses peer-to-peer technology to operate without central authority. Managing transactions and issuing digital assets is done collectively by the network.
Daereum is based on ERC20-Token in Ethereum Blockchain.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
